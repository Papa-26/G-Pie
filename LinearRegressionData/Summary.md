## Linear Regression Data
The purpose of this folder is to make the data files available, used for the linear regressions referred to in the draft paper entitled: Validating the Validation: the Achilles heel of Generalizability Analysis.

The folder contains three compressed zip directories relating to the three examples used: Brennan's Table 7.5ff, an OSCE test, and a Replication study.

Each directory contains:

- A control file for generating the data simulations, 
- Ten Monte Carlo simulations (Data) for this example according to the control file,
- Ten analysis result files generated by urGENOVA,
- Ten analysis result files generated by the python script,
- Two structured result files in .csv format for a linear regression plot and analysis in R, one for results of urGENOVA , the other for those of python.
