# G-Pie
### Python script for Generalizability Analysis, alpha version

This repository serves the Open-Source project for analyzing performance tests using generalizability analysis for nested, unbalanced designs according to the Henderson "quasi ANOVA" method. It provides similar functionality to Robert Brennan's urGENOVA, but in contrast, it is a Python script contained in 5 modules. In addition to performing the analysis, G-Pie can also generate synthetic data files to match a control file.

This being an alpha version, it requires some know-how from potential users.

The repository also contains all the data used in the linear regression studies for comparing G-Pie with urGENOVA

G-Pie is an extension of a prior project: [G-String](https://github.com/G-String-Legacy/GS_MV), a user-friendly shell around Robert  Brennan's urGENOVA.

A full version of Python-based G-Pie, which provides all G-String features, is almost complete.
